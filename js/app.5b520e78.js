to do something different than I usually do, so I'm building my site with Vue.js 3 from the ground up, also using Tailwind CSS for styles. I've been wanting to use both for a project for a while now, but always get roped into React with other developers. So far, I have to say learning Vue is mostly good stuff — you get to work with HTML on your own terms and can make it more semantic.",'Tailwind CSS and Vue look like a good fit for semantic HTML, which React using something like MUI doesn\'t seem to always be.

I've had an on and off relationship since my childhood, never thinking I was worthy. I've gotten over that and love it unequivocally now. I'm always learning.","Long Version: Starting back in the mid-90s, I was enamored with HTML. As a youth, I found as much enjoyment in managing and modifying existing gaming clan pages (Starcraft: Broodwar) as I did playing the game. I'm a community type of person as much as a techie kind of person. Of course, mySpace gave the world it's (probably) first look at CSS pages. I loved it (still kinda do to be honest).","Eventually, I wandered around until I was 20 and had to work, as I was a newlywed. Thus started a long span of (at the time) pointless jobs just to make some money. However, I eventually realized a narrative had played out. I went into graphic design just in time for print media to die and digital media to birth itself painfully into the world — and nearly invalidate all my design experience in its current form. As a new graduate in a world where everyone wanted me to make their pages, not just design them, I was lost.","I turned to WordPress and WAMPserver to help me understand how to design and create sites. I was so fed up with WordPress, but felt like I had no choice but to edit CSS myself. That was fine, and I made some great pages along the way. But the problem with it all was functionality (and working with PHP I didn't understand well).","After about 10 years of solid travel around the world, some online english teaching, and freelance graphic design, I started to feel the ache of not pursuing my dreams in career as much as I had hoped.","For me, money isn't the main draw (or I wouldn't have wanted to go into branding and graphic design). But as you get older, you realize, you have to at least make some. I've never met a teacher that didn't struggle, and frankly I was tired of struggling.","After years of HTML, CSS, and just getting to understand what some jQuery or JS was doing I pulled the trigger and decided to enter a Bootcamp to really get to know what software engineering is all about. I was tired of using things other people made and wanted to make it myself. If I could be paid well along the way, why not?","I have a passion for pretty much everything programming stands for. Solving problems, solving people's problems, teaching others, being taught, and helping the world no matter where you're from.","So here I am, now a software developer and engineer, using JS and its various frameworks and databases. I'm looking to get into Python, Solidity, and Rust eventually, but one thing at a time.","While traveling in Asia (India, Thailand, Laos, etc.), Europe, USA, and Oceania I was struck by the disparity in resources and what it wrought on the people. I wanted to do something but as one person (one not-so-naive person) with limited resources, I didn't know what I could accomplish.","It warms my heart to know that I could help that goal get met as I work, if I'm working with the right company. I don't know if I could help everyone, but I'd like to help as many as I can, wherever I am. I live a very modest life, always trying to give back to others and help where I can.","I want to be a success on my terms. Help my wife, my family, my husky, and as many people that need it as possible. That's success to me. I love to learn, I love to teach, and I love to travel. Recreation is great, but I get more fulfillment out of doing something important for others.","I know it's quite a read. The journey part especially, so don't feel obliged 😁","If you've read up until here, thank you very much for all you do.","Sincerely,","Jeremy Rogers"],experience:[{title:"Full Stack Software Developer",list:["Web and Desktop apps with Agile methodologies — solo or with a team","APIs and CRUD development based on wireframing and user-story generation","Modern front end JS frameworks like React-Redux and Vue.js 3"]},{title:"Graphic Designer",list:["Created several websites on WordPress using Affinity Design and Photo suite for asset creation","Logos, branding, style guides, app/website UI/UX, marketing materials, photo manipulation, etc.","GIF, MP4, and animations"]},{title:"SEO Content Writer",list:["Ghostwrite content in SEO formatting (Search Engine Optimization)","Technical writing on IT, software, hardware, optics, physics"]}],techStack:[{title:"Languages & Frameworks",list:["JavaScript","HTML","CSS","PHP","Python","TypeScript","React (hooks","Vue.js 3"]},{title:"CSS Frameworks",list:["SCSS","PostCSS","Tailwind CSS","Material UI","Bootstrap"]},{title:"Databases",list:["PostgreSQL","Firestore","NoSQL"]},{title:"Environments",list:["Electron.js","Node.js","Google Cloud Platform","Firebase","WSL","AWS Cloud9","Windows 10 & 11"]},{title:"Testing Frameworks",list:["Jasmine","Mocha","Chai"]},{title:"Other Dev Tools",list:["Git","Github","Webpack","Babel","Express","Sequelize","Heroku","Vite","ESLint","Prettier","VScode","XAMPP","WAMP server","Redux","React-Redux (hooks)","Bash","Zsh","PowerShell"]}],education:[{title:"Fullstack Academy, New York, NY",type:"Certificate in Software Engineering",year:"04/2022",desc:"17-Week Full Stack JavaScript Web Development Immersive Course"},{title:"United States Institute of Language and Cultural Studies, Miami, FL",type:"Bachelor of Arts in TESOL fundamentals and methodology",year:"10/2019"},{title:"Colorado Mountain College, Spring Valley, CO",type:"Associate of Applied Science in Graphic Design",year:"04/2015",desc:"Web and UI/UX design, Branding and Style Guides, Logo Design, Advertising"}]}}};const ne=(0,x.Z)(oe,[["render",te]]);var ae=ne;const re=(0,a._)("h1",{class:"text-2xl font-bold my-5"},"My Projects",-1),ie={class:"text-2xl text-center font-bold mb-3"},se=["href"],le={key:0,class:"indent-8 mb-2"},de={key:1,class:"mb-2"},ce={class:"text-center"},ue={key:0,class:"text-gray-200 text-base"};function he(e,t,o,n,i,s){return(0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("div",{class:(0,r.C_)(i.main)},[re,((0,a.wg)(!0),(0,a.iD)(a.HY,null,(0,a.Ko)(i.projects,(e=>((0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("article",{class:(0,r.C_)(i.card),key:e.id},[(0,a._)("h1",ie,[(0,a._)("a",{class:(0,r.C_)(i.anchor),href:e.uri,target:"_blank"},(0,r.zw)(e.title),11,se)]),((0,a.wg)(!0),(0,a.iD)(a.HY,null,(0,a.Ko)(e.summaries,((e,t)=>((0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("div",{key:t},[t<1?((0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("p",le,(0,r.zw)(e),1)):((0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("p",de,(0,r.zw)(e),1))])))),128)),(0,a._)("p",ce,[((0,a.wg)(!0),(0,a.iD)(a.HY,null,(0,a.Ko)(e.technologies,((t,o)=>((0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("span",{class:"text-sm text-green-400",key:o},[(0,a.Uk)((0,r.zw)(t)+" ",1),o!==e.technologies.length-1?((0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("span",ue," | ")):(0,a.kq)("",!0)])))),128))])],2)))),128))],2)}var ge=JSON.parse('[{"id":1,"title":"CryptKeeper","uri":"https://github.com/jonathan-jeremy/cryptkeeper","slug":"cryptkeeper","summaries":["CryptKeeper is an App that stores your passwords on an encrypted file called a cryptkeeper as <your_crypt>.cryptkeeper","It also stores user data for login to the app in an encrypted .CRYPT file.","The goal of CryptKeeper is to prevent any visibility of passwords, even to your system.
